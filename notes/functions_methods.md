# Functions v. Methods

Although used synonymously, there are differences between functions and methods. 


Methods are built into JavaScript.
Methods are invoked using dot notation:

Example:
    name.toUpperCase()

So, methods are functions, but they are defined on an object or data type. 


The difference lies in where we call them and where they are defined.
