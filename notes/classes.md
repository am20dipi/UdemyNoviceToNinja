# CLASSES IN JAVASCRIPT

* Class is like a blueprint for an object. It describes what the object should do and have (methods and properties).
* Classes allow for each instance instantiated of an object to have the same properties and methods. 
* Class Syntax in JS is syntactic sugar -- meaning it is a cleaner and more readable syntax for the prototypal foundation. 
* All classes in JavaScript have a constructor function:
    *  Constructors construct our object by setting the properties and methods to that object. 

* The 'new' keyword
    * The 'new' keyword is used to create a new empty object. 
    * It binds the value of 'this' keyword to the new empty object. 
    * It calls the constructor function to create the object. 

* The 'this' keyword
    * The 'this' keyword is used inside of a class and refers to the current instance.
    *  Every time a new instance of a class is invoked, 'this' is assigned a reference to an object based on how the new instance was called.
