## PRIMITIVE V. REFERENCE TYPES

### Primitive
* numbers
* strings
* booleans
* null
* undefined
* symbols

* Primitive types are stored in memory in the 'stack' 
* space in the stack is limited
* since space is limited, the stack is usually faster; things can be accessed quickly


### Reference
* objects
* arrays
* functions
* dates

* Reference types are stored in memory in the 'heap'
* space in the heap is not as limited as the stack; larger and more complex data types can be stored
* the heap is slower; access capability is less quick
