# FIREBASE

Firebase is a backend as a service; Firestore is NoSQL database.

Firebase takes care of server-side logic and heavy lifting so we can focus on our project. 

NoSQL databases are made up of documents, collections and properties. 

A Database Instance is a container for our data. 

A collection represents a specific type of data; todos, comments, likes...

Inside each collection are documents -- each document represents a specific todo, comment or like (each with an id).

Collections > Documents > Properties (Think JS Object)
