2. Install Node Package Manager (NPM).

## What is NodeJS?

* NodeJS is a JS environment that lets us run JS directly on your computer or on some kind of server; instead of JS running solely on the browser. 

## What is Node Package Manager?

* NPM is a package manager; packages are librares of pre-written code that can be installed onto an application for use. 
* Babel is an example of a package. 
* 'npm init' initializes a package.json file for your application. 
* Inside a package.json file are all of the packages you have installed -- including descriptions. 
* To install a package: 'npm install package_name'
