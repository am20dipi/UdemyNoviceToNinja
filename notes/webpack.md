# WEBPACK

Webpack is a module bundler. It contains multiple source files and bundles them into a single bundled file. 

Works well with Babel. 

By splitting our code into modules, we can create a more structured code base; more organzied, more dry. 

## Importing When Utilizing Modules

* import 'file name' to import a file into another file. 
* import { variable, function name } from 'file name' to import particular variable or functions from a file to be used in an another file. 
* place 'export' before variable and function names in order to be accessible in other files.
